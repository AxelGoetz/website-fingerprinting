SVC attack described in "Website Fingerprinting in Onion Routing Based Anonymization Networks" and "Website Fingerprinting at Internet Scale".
However in both papers, different features were used.

A. Panchenko et al. used a radial basis function (RBF) as a kernel with C = 2^{17} and Î³ = 2^{-19}
For "Website Fingerprinting at Internet Scale" they used a range of values but for the purpose of this report, we will just use these values.
