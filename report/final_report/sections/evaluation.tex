\section{Evaluation and Testing}

\subsection{Evaluation Techniques}
% How to evaluate the seq2seq model + how to evaluate individual models

\subsubsection{Sequence-to-Sequence Model}
% Include own training error on copy task

\subsection{Evaluation}
% Include different models

% Did the design do the job you intended, or were there problems?
% Is your solution fit for purpose?
% How does the resulting system compare against the competition?


\subsection{Testing}
% Talk about unit tests
